# Git Help
Some general tips and tricks to help you get started or refreshed on using git in a good and regulated manner. This document outlines best practices, as well as why each thing is best practice. 

## Forking
Forking will create your own copy of the EV_MCU repository on your own GitHub account. You have full control of this repository. [[Peter write more about forking please]]

## Git Clone
This is the command to pull a fresh copy of a repository. To clone a repository, you will first need to generate a token. Once you have this token, [[someone please write more I use CLE over anything else whenever possible -Myfanwy]]

## Git Commit, Push, and Pull
Commit changes often, and push regularly. Every time you change one thing, make a commit, and add a small descrition of what you changed. Every time you finish a big thing, or when you finish a working session, make a push, with a small explaination of everything you changed. This creates a really easy trail of documentation you or someone else can look back on


# General good practice
These things make better, cleaner, easier to read code! This makes very slightly more work for you now, but WAY less work for you and others in the future

## Last steps before merging
Before you submit a pull request to merge your branch or fork with main, please merge main with your own branch. This will prevent someone else from dealing with your merge conflicts. It is encouraged to merge main with your own branch more often than not. This could be once a week, or after you know someone else has merged. GitHub should tell you you are x commits ahead and x commits behind main. Commits ahead are how many commits you've made, commits behind are changes on main you should merge into your own repository.

## Naming
There are two common conventions for names. CamelCase and snake_case. You may use either, but make the name short and desriptive Please remain consistent within files. Use numbers, letters, and underscores. Avoid other characters when possible. Try to make variable and function names as unique as possible. Above each function, there should be a comment explaining what it does. You make a comment in C by adding "//" before a line.

//This is a comment!
#### CamelCase
Camelcase is a style of writing fucntion or variable names. Each word or part of a name is capitalized, except the first word. 
IE: 
fan controller becomes fanController
compute torque becomes computeTorque

#### snake_case
Snake case is a style of writing function or variable names. All letters are lowercase, and between each word is an underscore.

#### Function name examples
**Some examples of good function names:**
fanController
fan_controller
drivingLoop
compute_torque

**Some examples of bad function names:**
MyFunction
x
this_does_the_computation_of_torque_for_the_university_of_victoria_electric_vehicle
cmpoot_tork
DriVinglOOp

#### Variable name examples
**Some examples of good variable names:**
calculatedTorque
brakePressure

**Some examples of bad variable names:**
x
abc
abcd
abcde
tq
matilda
üçÜ
brakepressure
bra_kepressu_re
